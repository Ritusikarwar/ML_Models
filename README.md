📰 News Headline Text Classification using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project is a machine learning–based text classification system that predicts the category of a news headline using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The model uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features and Logistic Regression as the classifier to predict the category of unseen news headlines.

🎯 Objective
To build a supervised ML model that classifies news headlines into predefined categories such as politics, sports, health, business, etc.

🧠 Workflow
Load and inspect the dataset
Remove unnecessary columns
Preprocess text data
Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF
Split data into training and testing sets
Train Logistic Regression model
Evaluate model performance
Predict categories for new headlines
